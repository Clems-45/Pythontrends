- i should have figured how use the arg method 
*to create, write and read unto files , delete from files
 .insert into a specific line or point when specified 
 .delete  from a specific line or point when specified
 .write including concatenation unto  a specific line or point when specified
 #replace  a specific line or point when specified

 -figure out if i cant survive without the arg and i cant use just the 
 script to create without the arg initializing thing
